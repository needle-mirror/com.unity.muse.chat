# Interact with Unity GameObjects and Console errors

You can use Muse Chat to interact contextually with GameObjects and console errors directly within the Unity Editor. You can query and receive information about the selected component using natural language through Muse Chat.

## Prerequisites

These instructions assume that you have integrated and docked Muse Chat in the Unity Editor.

For more information, refer to [Install Muse Chat with the Package Manager](install-chat.md#launch-the-tool).

## Engage with development tools and environment

1. To interact with the GameObjects or the **Console** errors:

   **For GameObjects**

   In the **Scene** view or **Hierarchy** window, select one or more GameObjects.

   To select multiple GameObjects, press **Ctrl** (macOS: **Cmd**) and select each object.

   **For Console errors**

    1. To open the **Console** window, in the main menu, go to **Window** > **Panels** > **Console**.
    2. In the **Console** window, select one or more error messages.
2. Muse Chat automatically displays the GameObject or error you selected and uses it as context to answer queries. You can now interact with Muse Chat as you normally would.
